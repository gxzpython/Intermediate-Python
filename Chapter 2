Motivation for dictionaries
To see why dictionaries are useful, have a look at the two lists defined on the right. countries contains the names of some European countries. capitals lists the corresponding names of their capital.

# Definition of countries and capital
countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']

# Get index of 'germany': ind_ger
ind_ger = countries.index('germany')

# Use ind_ger to print out capital of Germany
print(capitals[ind_ger])

Create dictionary
The countries and capitals lists are again available in the script. It's your job to convert this data to a dictionary where the country names are the keys and the capitals are the corresponding values. As a refresher, here is a recipe for creating a dictionary:

my_dict = {
   "key1":"value1",
   "key2":"value2",
}
In this recipe, both the keys and the values are strings. This will also be the case for this exercise.

# Definition of countries and capital
countries = ['spain', 'france', 'germany', 'norway']
capitals = ['madrid', 'paris', 'berlin', 'oslo']

# From string in countries and capitals, create dictionary europe
europe = { 'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 
'germany':'berlin', 'norway':'oslo' }
# Print europe
print(europe)



Dictionary Manipulation (1)
If you know how to access a dictionary, you can also assign a new value to it. To add a new key-value pair to europe you can use something like this:

europe['iceland'] = 'reykjavik'
# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin', 'norway':'oslo' }

# Add italy to europe
europe['italy']='rome'

# Print out italy in europe
print(europe['italy'])

# Add poland to europe
europe['poland']='warsaw'

# Print europe
print(europe)


Dictionary Manipulation (2)
Somebody thought it would be funny to mess with your accurately generated dictionary. An adapted version of the europe dictionary is available in the script on the right.

Can you clean up? Do not do this by adapting the definition of europe, but by adding Python commands to the script to update and remove key:value pairs.
# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'bonn',
          'norway':'oslo', 'italy':'rome', 'poland':'warsaw',
          'australia':'vienna' }

# Update capital of germany
europe['germany']='berlin'

# Remove australia
del(europe['australia'])

# Print europe
print(europe)



Dictionariception
Remember lists? They could contain anything, even other lists. Well, for dictionaries the same holds. Dictionaries can contain key:value pairs where the values are again dictionaries.

As an example, have a look at the script where another version of europe - the dictionary you've been working with all along - is coded. The keys are still the country names, but the values are dictionaries that contain more information than just the capital.

It's perfectly possible to chain square brackets to select elements. To fetch the population for Spain from europe, for example, you need:

europe['spain']['population']


# Dictionary of dictionaries
europe = { 'spain': { 'capital':'madrid', 'population':46.77 },
           'france': { 'capital':'paris', 'population':66.03 },
           'germany': { 'capital':'berlin', 'population':80.62 },
           'norway': { 'capital':'oslo', 'population':5.084 } }


# Print out the capital of France
print(europe['france']['capital'])

# Create sub-dictionary data
data = {'capital' : 'rome','population' : 59.83}

# Add data to europe under key 'italy'
europe['italy']=data

# Print europe
print(europe)




Dictionary to DataFrame (1)
Pandas is an open source library, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. Sounds promising!

The DataFrame is one of Pandas' most important data structures. It's basically a way to store tabular data where you can label the rows and the columns. One way to build a DataFrame is from a dictionary.

In the exercises that follow you will be working with vehicle data from different countries. Each observation corresponds to a country and the columns give information about the number of vehicles per capita, whether people drive left or right, and so on.

Three lists are defined in the script:

names, containing the country names for which data is available.
dr, a list with booleans that tells whether people drive left or right in the corresponding country.
cpc, the number of motor vehicles per 1000 people in the corresponding country.
Each dictionary key is a column label and each value is a list which contains the column elements.
